The New York Times article [Flush with Cash, Biden Eclipses Trump in War for the Airwaves](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/17/us/politics/trump-biden-campaign-ad-spending.html) covers ad spending in the months prior to the 2020 Presidential election across the nation. The central insight the reporters wanted to communicate was Biden's overall higher spending on television advertisements and the difference in campaign approaches in battleground states and counties. The reporters would receive a 5 on their ability to communicate the main message of this reporting. 

The data visualizations included in this article were very effective. They were simple to read and digest and would overall receive a 5 for those reasons. These graphs also changed in type and scale based on the information they were attempting to visualize. The sources for the information used included Advertising Analytics and Harvard Dataverse. As for the sources interviewed, the reporters interviewed professors specializing in politics and ad strategists. The data was not at any point questionable as they had credibke sources from which they gathered this information, however, it would still receive a grade of 4 as the inferences they make based on the data as well as the data itself could have been corrobarated by members of each campaign had they been interviewed. The overall quality of the reporting would be 5 as it does take information and high amounts of money and visualizes them in a maner easliy digestable to those who may not be as knowledgeable in advertising, particulary during in an election cycle where all kinds of people are consuming this information. 

The reporters use color and type of graph well to show data. For example, they use a map of the United States and color to show the two presidentials spending in comparison to each other across the nation in certain areas. This type of visualization was effective as it showed what regions the campaigns were spending the most money and placing the most importance in. Thus receiving a 5. Likewise, the use of color would also receive a 5 as it allows for the reader to actually see the difference in spending amounts as oppposed to a table or line graph. For creativity, the story does not use much creative elements to draw the reader in aside from analysis and examples of how previous presidential campaigns have approached broadcast advertising, therefore only receiving a 2. 

# Story Pitch 

Over the summer, Washington D.C.'s public bus routes were significantly changed in the name of creating more efficient and servicible routes while also cutting out low usage or obsolete bus stops, however not all residents of the city are content with the changes or feel that these goals were met. This story would explore both public opinion on the route changes and whether or not the changes are effective or needed in the first place. Data that would be useful would would be WMATA's performance reports and the National Transit Database. Sources could include WMATA employees themselves and residents affected by these route changes. This story is timely as it is a recent change and impacts people across the city.
