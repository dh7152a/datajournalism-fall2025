# California Extreme Heat Deaths 

## Lede
The kind of lede used in this story could be argued to be a combination of several kinds of ledes such as a descriptive lede and summary lede. However, in the grafs following the initial lede, the use of anecdotal stories are used to both present information and interest the reader. I believe the use of this combination of ledes was very effective both structurally and narratively, but also as a means of informing the reader. 
## The Data 
The data used in this story aimed to show the threat which extreme heat presents to people, specifically in California, and the under reporting of heat related deaths. I felt the data did was extremely relevant and well communicated in the article, paricularly in reagrds to the rising temperatures over time in California and the potential increase of heat related deaths over the next several decades. The data really helped communicate the urgency of the matter and the lack of importance placed upon it. 
## Sources 
The sources in this story included professionals who are well informed on the matter, which is always important, but equally as important, the story also included sources that were directly impacted by these heat related deaths. The inclusion of these sources and anectdotal stories makes the data really come to life and appear to the reader as more than just numbers and information and rather as real people who lost their lives to an "invisible" and preventable force. These sources greatly helped the story and largely agreed with the articles findings. 
## Story Structure 
The story structure largely follows a bookend style, using anecdotal stories to introduce information and returning to the story to further the narrative. This method was very effective and keeps the reader engaged with not only the data but the article itself as a motivator to continue reading. This structure is best exemplified by the story's kicker, which returns to a previous story about an the death of an individual's father. 
## Numbers 
I thought the use of numbers was executed well and in an engaging manner. At no point did I feel the article was confusing or too reliant on its data. As mentioned before, I think the use of anecdotes and data was greatly effective in keeping the reader engaged with the data. 
## Data Viz
The data visualization in this story was really effective and well designed. I thought the interactivity of the visualizations was a great means of getting the reader to develop a deeper understanding of the data and to quite literally interact with the data in order to answer any questions they may have had. The visualization of potential increase of heat related deaths in California specifically was well executed as it allowed the reader to localize the data and further understand the risk it poses to them and the region they are in. 
## Methods
I really appreciated the process description of how the data was gathered and analyzed both within the story and the ner box below it. I found the descriptive telling of how the excess deaths were calculated to be really informative and legitimizes the data even further. I also personally just really appreciate process journalism and when journalists engage with their reader by describing the actual process of finding and executing the story.
